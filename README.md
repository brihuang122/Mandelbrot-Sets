mandelbrot.py contains the first task of Homework 4. Using NumPy and Matplotlib in the Python script, the function takes n, N_max, and threshold as inputs to generate the Mandelbrot set. This image can be seen in mandelbrot.png. The code first constructs a nxn grid, a 2D array, from the given ranges of x and y. The values in this grid are the corresponding complex values, which are found from the equation c=x+yi. Using the c-values, z is computed and used to form a 2D boolean array mask. The graph is plotted using commands from Matplotlib and tested with the input values of n=50, N_max=50, and threshold=50. markov_chain.py is the second task of Homework 4. It first creates a random and normalized n-vector that contains only positive entries and gives us p, a probability distribution. A nxn matrix is then constructed, also containing only positive entries and normalized rows, and gives us the transition matrix P. A for loop is used to compute the transition for N. The function np.linalg.eig then gives us the eigenvector of P.T corresponding to the largest eigenvalue. The last part of the code is another for loop that computes the norm of p-p_stationary and plots the norms against i. The code was then tested with the inputs n=5 and N=50.
